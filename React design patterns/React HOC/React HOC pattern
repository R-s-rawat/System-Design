// Problem:  Understanding React Hooks with Higher-Order Components 

// You are given a React application consisting of multiple components that demonstrate the use of React Hooks and Higher-Order Components (HOCs).

The application includes two main components, Comp1 and Comp2, which display their width using a HOC named WithDimension. 

Your task is to understand how to use React Hooks to manage state and references, and how to create and utilize Higher-Order Components to add additional functionality to existing components.

####################
Components Overview
####################
App Component: The main component that renders Comp1 and Comp2.
Comp1 Component: A functional component wrapped with WithDimension HOC that displays its width.
Comp2 Component: Another functional component wrapped with WithDimension HOC that displays its width.
WithDimension HOC: A Higher-Order Component that uses React Hooks to pass dimensions (width and height) as props to the wrapped component.

Objective
############
Understand how to use useRef to access a DOM element.
Learn to use useEffect to perform side effects in functional components.
Implement a Higher-Order Component to extend the functionality of existing components by injecting additional props.
